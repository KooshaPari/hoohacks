      6 hours of sleep and lower physical activity. Your heart rate was also slightly elevated

      Sleep Duration: You averaged ${analysisData.sleepSymptomAvg} hours of sleep on ${analysisData.symptom} days vs. ${analysisData.sleepNonSymptomAvg} hours on ${analysisData.symptom}-free days.

      Physical Activity: Your step count was significantly ${
        analysisData.stepsSymptomAvg < analysisData.stepsNonSymptomAvg ? 'lower' : 'higher'
      } on days with ${analysisData.symptom} (${analysisData.stepsSymptomAvg} steps vs. ${analysisData.stepsNonSymptomAvg} steps).

      These are observed correlations only, not necessarily cause-and-effect relationships.
