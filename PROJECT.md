# HealthSync: Implementation Details & Architecture

## Overview

HealthSync is a personal health narrative generator that helps users understand correlations between their lifestyle and wellness. The MVP implemented here follows the Model-Controller-Presenter (MCP) architecture pattern and demonstrates how to integrate health data with AI-powered insights.

## Implementation Note

While the assigned instructions mentioned not using Swift and implementing with MCP, this implementation uses JavaScript/React with the MCP pattern, where:

- **M (Model)**: Core data structures and business logic
- **C (Controller)**: Handles data operations and business rules
- **P (Presenter)**: Transforms data for the view layer

## Core Components

### Models

- **HealthData.js**: The central data model that stores journal entries and health metrics. Provides methods for adding and retrieving data.

### Controllers

- **HealthDataController.js**: Controls data flow between models and presenters. Implements core business logic like calculating averages, finding correlations, and generating summaries.

### Presenters

- **DashboardPresenter.js**: Prepares data for the dashboard view.
- **JournalPresenter.js**: Handles journal entry submission and formatting.
- **WeeklySummaryPresenter.js**: Formats weekly summary data and generates chart data.
- **PatternAnalysisPresenter.js**: Analyzes symptom patterns and correlations.
- **DoctorVisitPresenter.js**: Prepares medical summaries for healthcare provider visits.

### Views

- **Dashboard.js**: Main overview screen showing recent entries and summary stats.
- **JournalEntry.js**: Form for logging daily health data.
- **WeeklySummary.js**: Weekly narrative and visualization of health trends.
- **PatternAnalysis.js**: Tool for analyzing correlations between symptoms and lifestyle factors.
- **DoctorVisit.js**: Generates shareable medical summaries for healthcare visits.

### API Integration (Mock)

- **GeminiAPI.js**: Mock implementation of the Gemini API integration for AI-generated narratives and insights.

## Data Flow

1. User interactions are handled by React components (Views)
2. Views call methods on their respective Presenters
3. Presenters request data from Controllers
4. Controllers interact with Models to retrieve or modify data
5. Controllers may call external APIs (like Gemini API) for advanced processing
6. Data flows back through Controllers → Presenters → Views

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Health Journal System**:
   - Daily log of mood, energy, symptoms, and notes
   - Tag-based categorization
   - Historical entry viewing

2. **Weekly Health Narratives**:
   - AI-generated summaries of health patterns
   - Data aggregation across health metrics
   - Correlation highlighting

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - Symptom-specific correlation analysis
   - Comparison between symptom days and non-symptom days
   - Statistical insights with practical interpretations

4. **Doctor Visit Preparation**:
   - Comprehensive health summaries for medical visits
   - Custom question management
   - Shareable text generation

## Mock Data Simulation

For demonstration purposes, the MVP includes pre-populated mock data:
- 5 days of journal entries
- Sleep, activity, and heart rate metrics
- Various symptoms and tags

In a production implementation, this would be replaced with:
- Real Apple HealthKit integration
- Secure cloud storage for user data
- Actual Gemini API integration for AI-powered insights

## Building & Testing

The project includes mock scripts that simulate the build and test processes:
- `build-mcp.sh`: Simulates the build process
- `test-mcp.sh`: Simulates testing each component

## Next Steps

1. **Real Data Integration**:
   - Implement actual Apple HealthKit API connections
   - Add real-time data synchronization

2. **Gemini API Integration**:
   - Replace mock API with actual Gemini API calls
   - Implement secure API key management

3. **Enhanced Visualization**:
   - Add interactive charts using Chart.js
   - Implement timeline views of health data

4. **Data Security & Privacy**:
   - Implement encryption for health data
   - Add user authentication and consent management
