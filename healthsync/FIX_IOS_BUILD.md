# Fix for iOS Build Issues

I've identified and fixed several issues that were causing the `dart:js_interop is not available on this platform` error when building for iOS:

## Changes Made:

1. **Removed direct dependency on the `web` package**:
   - This package is designed for web-only use and includes imports of `dart:js_interop`
   - It's been commented out in pubspec.yaml

2. **Fixed direct import of the web package in auth_service.dart**:
   - Removed the import of `package:web/web.dart`
   - Created a platform-agnostic helper for URL operations

3. **Ensured proper conditional imports**:
   - Updated platform_web.dart to properly handle web-specific code

## How to Complete the Fix:

1. **Make the cleanup script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x cleanup.sh
   ```

2. **Run the cleanup script**:
   ```bash
   ./cleanup.sh
   ```

3. **Try building for iOS again**:
   ```bash
   flutter build ios
   ```

## If Issues Persist:

1. **Manually clean the pub cache**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/web-1.1.1
   ```

2. **Run flutter clean and get dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **If you still see references to the web package**, check your build environment by running:
   ```bash
   flutter pub deps | grep web
   ```

4. **For additional debugging**, you can use:
   ```bash
   flutter build ios --verbose
   ```

These changes maintain functionality for both web and mobile platforms by properly conditional imports and platform-specific code paths.
